<div style=font-size:.7rem;margin:1.2rem;padding:.5rem;background:#f7c9d0><p>This is a draft post that I have prematurely published. Currently, I am attending RC and I want to write as much as possible, log my daily learnings and activities. But, I also don't want to spend time on grammar and prose, so I am publishing all the posts which usually I'd have kept in my draft folder.</p></div>
<p>The first week of the Recurse Center is important and more special than the other weeks. Here is what all happened.</p>
<h2 id=first-week>First Week</h2>
<p>The first week of RC is filled with activities, meeting all the people in my batch, currently at RC, and alumni. The majority of my time was spent on these events and I also spent some time attending the study groups, just trying to get a taste of them.</p>
<p>I think I did fine. Before joining RC, I had this fear of getting kicked out if I am not doing good progress. Turns out that isn&rsquo;t true at all. I was so relieved!</p>
<p>Whatever I had read about RC on the internet turned out to be true and it is indeed a magical place if you are a programmer.</p>
<p>My advice to new recursers: the first week can be overwhelming as there are so many things going on and it&rsquo;s okay! Try to attend all the events, try new study groups and meet everyone in your batch. Zoom fatigue is real, if you are tired take a step back, take some time off, and rest.</p>
<h2 id=checkins>Checkins</h2>
<p>I am attempting to write everyday about the things I am learning/doing, here are all the blog posts:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href=https://avi.im/blag/2021/rc-day-1/>Day 1</a></li>
<li><a href=https://avi.im/blag/2021/rc-day-2/>Day 2</a></li>
<li><a href=https://avi.im/blag/2021/rc-day-3/>Day 3</a></li>
<li><a href=https://avi.im/blag/2021/rc-day-4/>Day 4</a></li>
<li><a href=https://avi.im/blag/2021/rc-day-5/>Day 5</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Writing every day takes a good chunk of my time, however, I am also enjoying writing so I am hoping to continue this ritual, as one of my RC goals was to get better at writing.</p>
<p>PS: I should add tag feature to this blog and group all the RC post together.</p>
