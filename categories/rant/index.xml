I am only sharing my experience and frustrations with Python, cos that's the language I use.
I started learning to program with Python, which holds a special place in my heart. It&amp;rsquo;s the language which taught me how to think about programming, modelling a problem to code and communicate with the machine. I was hired at my current job (or the previous one) because of Python.</description></item></channel></rss>
