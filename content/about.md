Hey there! This is Avinash. I am a programmer from India. I mostly code in Python but learning Swift these days. I have dabbled little in Web Development using Python Tornado. 

<!-- And I am available for hire. If you have new job opportunities, [get in touch with me](http://scr.im/avii). Thanks! -->

## On Interwebz

- [GitHub](http://github.com/avinassh) — Some of the Open Source code I have written and contributed.
- [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1382297/avi) — I read the Python tagged questions often.
- [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=avinassh) — Pretty much addicted to this.
- [Twitter](http://twitter.com/iavins) — I am mostly active on this thing.

## Machine

I use **Dell XPS L501x** (bought in Dec, 2010) for all my development work. It's config is Intel i7 740M (First Gen/Nehalem), 8GB DDR3, Samsung 840 Pro 256GB,  nVidia GT435m. It also has a gorgeous RGB LED 15.5" Full HD (1080p) display. I have been hackintoshing since I bought my laptop and currently I am running Yosemite 10.10.1 dualbooted with Windows 8, in UEFI mode in a non-EFI legacy BIOS.

In May 2015, I bought myself a **MacBook Pro** 13.3", 2015 Retina Display model. It's config is 2.7GHz dual-core Intel Core i5, 8GB 1866MHz LPDDR3 memory, 256GB PCIe-based flash storage, Intel Iris Graphics 6100. I needed 16GB RAM model, but in India, customised MacBooks are not available. So I ended up with 8GB RAM :(

I use Sublime Text 3 for Python development. Xcode for OSX/Swift. Learning vi also. I use iTerm2 instead of Terminal.
