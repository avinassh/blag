Hey thereðŸ‘‹ I am v. I work at [Turso Database](https://turso.tech/). I am interested in databases, message queues, and distributed systems in general. I am learning Rust and building an [educational project](https://github.com/avinassh/py-caskdb/) that aims to teach anyone building a KV Store by passing tests.

<!-- ## Machine

I use **Dell XPS L501x** (bought in Dec, 2010) for all my development work. It's config is Intel i7 740M (First Gen/Nehalem), 8GB DDR3, Samsung 840 Pro 256GB,  nVidia GT435m. It also has a gorgeous RGB LED 15.5" Full HD (1080p) display. I have been hackintoshing since I bought my laptop and currently I am running Yosemite 10.10.1 dualbooted with Windows 8, in UEFI mode in a non-EFI legacy BIOS.

In May 2015, I bought myself a **MacBook Pro** 13.3", 2015 Retina Display model. It's config is 2.7GHz dual-core Intel Core i5, 8GB 1866MHz LPDDR3 memory, 256GB PCIe-based flash storage, Intel Iris Graphics 6100. I needed 16GB RAM model, but in India, customised MacBooks are not available. So I ended up with 8GB RAM :(

I use Sublime Text 3 for Python development. Xcode for OSX/Swift. Learning vi also. I use iTerm2 instead of Terminal. -->
