**Update**: I have removed the blog post. TLDR; On 12th of May I had discovered a vulnerability on Gaana.com. I contacted their team and it was fixed recently. I had written blog post in detail about it, now I think it's best I remove everything. Thanks for reading!

<!--of course you can find it if you look deep enough. can you ever remove anything from the internet?-->
