Today I received my acceptance email to the Recurse Center, I just started jumping around everywhere out of sheer joy. I learned about RC somewhere in 2016 from Julia Evans' blog, from the series of articles on [TCP stack implementation in Python](https://jvns.ca/blog/2013/11/06/day-23-started-writing-a-socket-library/). Ever since it has been my dream to attend RC. I had been obsessed with it, read almost everyone's application and interview process, RC experience, whatever there is on the internet.

I am too happy, and I can't wait to start my batch on Nov 1st, 2021.
