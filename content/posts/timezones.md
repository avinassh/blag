summary: "my experience of using time in programming"

- Usage of time for created_at, updated_at
- Use UTC for past events
- ISO format does not capture location / timezone detail, only offset
- However, a multiple timezones can have same offset, so it would be difficult to capture timezone info from the ISO format
- The offsets can change for a timezone
- Timezone can change for a location too
- For recurring events, never save the data in UTC!
- Usage: Recurring Outreach/Campaign -- saved in UTC
- Business Hours: Saved with Timezone info, but not location
