<div style="font-size: 0.7rem; margin: 1.2rem; padding: 0.5rem; background: #f7c9d0;"><p>This is a draft post that I have prematurely published. Currently, I am attending RC and I want to write as much as possible, log my daily learnings and activities. But, I also don't want to spend time on grammar and prose, so I am publishing all the posts which usually I'd have kept in my draft folder.</p></div>

This blog post chronicles my week before the start of RC.

 I got access to most of RC tools a week before, these included access to:

1. Github Wiki
2. Zulip
3. Virtual RC
4. Community Forums (but only few subforums)

Wiki has excellently written a lot of articles, the two important one was on onboarding and another was on scoping and choosing projects.

I mostly spent my reading all the pages on Wiki, and getting myself familiar with all the RC tools.
