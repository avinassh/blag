I hadn't posted my checkins and updates on my blog because the Recurse Center had a winter break from 13th December, and the RC will start again from 3rd January. I had specifically picked this batch to get three weeks of vacation, which I had decided to use this time to catch up on my projects and get a headstart on future projects. However, I decided to take a step back, unwind, and enjoy the break.

I binged many movies and TV shows this time, and it was well spent. Here are my top five TV recommendations:

- Unbelievable
- Queen's Gambit (the book is excellent too)
- Atypical
- Ted Lasso
- Normal People
