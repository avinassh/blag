      <description>Last week Amazon India had a Treasure Hunt contest which ran for a whole week. The contest was simple, from 10am to 6pm, every hour Amazon would display a clue (image) and you had to guess the product. That particular product would be on sale for â‚¹1, which also included shipping cost anywhere in India. The contest was app only i.e. image also would be displayed in the app and you had to buy using the app.</description>

      <description>Update: I have removed the blog post. TLDR; On 12th of May I had discovered a vulnerability on Gaana.com. I contacted their team and it was fixed recently. I had written blog post in detail about it, now I think it&amp;rsquo;s best I remove everything. Thanks for reading!
